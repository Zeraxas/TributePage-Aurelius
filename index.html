                        <p class="description u-mb-s">
                            Marcus Aurelius (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; 26 April 121 – 17 March 180 AD) was Roman emperor from 161 to 180. He ruled with his adoptive brother, Lucius Verus, until Verus' death in 169, and with his son, Commodus, from 177. He was the last successor of rulers traditionally known as the Five Good Emperors.

                        <p class="description u-mb-s">
                            Among Roman Emperors he has been called "The Philosopher". He was a practitioner of Stoicism, and his personal philosophical writings, which later came to be called Meditations, are a significant source of the modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius" target="_blank" class="btn btn--gold btn-link" id="tribute-link">Read more &rarr;</a>

Though he can hardly have known his father, Aurelius wrote in his Meditations that he had learned "modesty and manliness" from his memories of his father.

                        Marcus’s choice of his only surviving son as his successor has always been viewed as a tragic paradox. Commodus (reigned as sole emperor 180–192) turned out badly, though two things must be borne in mind: emperors are good and bad in the ancient sources according as they did or did not satisfy the senatorial governing class, and Commodus’s rapid calling off of the northern campaigns may well have been wiser than his father’s obsessive and costly expansionism.

                            This is historically untenable. Marcus had no choice in the matter: if he had not made Commodus his successor, he would have had to order him to be put to death. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Aurelius-Roman-emperor" class="btn btn--white-gold btn-link" target="_blank">Read more &rarr;</a>
